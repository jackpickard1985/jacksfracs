# jacksfracs
Koch-based fractal geometry for randomly initialted never-ending output with cycling colours

This was built in python 2.7 and it needs the turtle mod to run which it should import

You can see some results at https://youtu.be/CDbiFAi6j04

Variations on the same code have also been used to produce my still images at http://www.jacksfractals.com

It will make jumping mellow shapes forever
